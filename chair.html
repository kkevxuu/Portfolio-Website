                    The Crane Chair is modeled after a traditional Crane Dance known as "Dongnae" performed by the Joseonjok Korean ethnic group. Dancers imitate the ritualistic mating dance of cranes, with flowing fabrics on their body further enhancing the sense of dynamism. <br><br>Elegant and sustainable, the crane chair aims to bring the beauty of this traditional art form closer to people, integrating into their everyday life.

                <p class="detailtext">
                    Lounge chairs are more than just a place to sit. They’re lasting designs that often resonate on a deeper level, becoming a cherished part of a person’s daily life. 
                    <br><br><strong>The Crane Dance, which captures the graceful nature of cranes in the wild, integrates cohesively with the chair’s circular construction and natural materials. </strong>Art isn't an added luxury or decorative element, but rather woven into the chair’s function. The intention was to evoke emotions of the Crane Dance through the form, with each curve derived from choreographed movements, adding to the experience and the story behind the chair.

                    Inspired by looms used in the traditional textiles and tapestry, the rope weave construction of the Crane Chair pays tribute to the flowing clothing worn by the dancers. The wooden backing beam, as well as the tighter weave pattern at the center, mimic the traditional furniture-making techniques in East Asia of that time period, and provide additional back support.

                    Materials and construction on the Crane Chair are all carefully considered. The use of recycled ropes to construct the seating surface eliminate the need for any polyurethane foam, a harmful material common in the furniture industry. Sourcing low carbon sustainable wood pieces. Everything is easily recyclable and fully circular.
