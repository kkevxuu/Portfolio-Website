                    The Crane Chair is modeled after a traditional Crane Dance known as "Dongnae" performed by the Joseonjok Korean ethnic group. Dancers imitate the ritualistic mating dance of cranes, with flowing fabrics on their body further enhancing the sense of dynamism. <br><br>Elegant and sustainable, the crane chair aims to bring the beauty of this traditional art form closer to people, integrating into their everyday life.

                    Minimalistic design certainly has its place. It can simplify complex tasks in our day-to-day, helping us get from A to B. Many great designs today follow this philosophy of function driven form, and stripping everything down to it's essentials.

                    However, many products have started to look similar and uninspiring following the rising trend of minimalism. <br><br> <strong>Designs that blindly pursue minimalism purely for minimalism's sake frequently sacrifice the emotional component of design. </strong> Form and function are inseperable concepts; and form-giving is a crucial aspect of design.

                    Designs can be enchanting, delightful, and invoke human desire. The design of furniture, clothing, and automobiles become a way of <strong>self-expression</strong> for people, beyond their original purpose. <br><br><strong>Beauty isn't an added luxury</strong>; its woven into the fabric of the object's function. Forms that invoke emotions, that attract and intrigue people, that acknowledge and speak to the inner human are an important component in lasting designs that are cherished and kept for a long time. 

                    <br><br>I set out to create a chair that makes a statement: <strong>form is function. </strong>Form isnt just decorative, its essential to the design's overall purpose. 

                    This chair isn’t just a place to sit, it aims to be a lasting design that resonates on a deeper level, becoming a cherished part of someone's daily life.

                    I wanted to constrain myself to a more traditional design language. Inspired by looms used in the traditional textiles and tapestry, the rope weave construction pays tribute to the clothing worn by the dancers. The central beam shown with the waving of the rope mimics traditional furniture-making in Asia of that time period.
