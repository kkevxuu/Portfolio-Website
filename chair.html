                    The Crane Chair is modeled after by the traditional Crane Dance "Dongnae" performed by the Joseonjok Korean ethnic group. Dancers imitate the mating dance of cranes, with flowing fabrics on their body further enhancing the dynamism. Lightweight and airy, this chair aims to bring the beauty of dance into everyday life.

                    Minimalistic design has its place. It simplifies overly complex tasks in our day-to-day, helping us get from A to B. Many great designs we know today helped popularize this philosophy of minimalism and function driven form that strips everything down to it's essentials.

                    However, many products have started to look similar and uninspiring following the rising trend of minimalism.<strong> Products that blindly pursue the minimalist design language purely for minimalism's sake frequently sacrifice the emotional component of design. </strong><br><br>Form and function are inseperable concepts; and form-giving is a crucial aspect of design.

                    Designs can be enchanting. Forms can invoke universal human desire. The Design of furniture, clothing, and automobiles are powerful way of self expression for people. Forms that makes people feel emotions, that attract and intrigue people, that acknowledge the inner human are an important component in lasting designs that are cherished and kept for a long time. 

                    <br><br>I set out to create a chair that makes a statement: <strong>form is function. </strong>Harking back to the sleek, enchanting curves of the 30s, because not everything has to be essential and minimal.

                    Inspired by the elegant crane dance of the Korean minority group, this crane chair serves to bring the beauty of a traditional dance into a persons everyday life. Its form and function together as one. 
 

                    (self expression on other hand) a curved line will always have more energy than a straight line
                    minimalism for minimalism's sake. making a form beautiful isnt just decorating. Form is not frivolous/decorative! form and function cannot be separated.

                    I wanted to constrain myself to a more traditional design language. Inspired by looms used in the traditional textiles and tapestry, the rope weave construction pays tribute to the clothing worn by the dancers. The central beam shown with the waving of the rope mimics traditional furniture-making in Asia of that time period.
