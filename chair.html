                    The Crane Chair is modeled after a traditional Crane Dance known as <strong>"Dongnae"</strong> performed by the Joseonjok Korean ethnic group. Dancers imitate the ritualistic mating dance of cranes, with flowing fabrics on their body further enhancing the sense of dynamism. <br><br>Elegant and sustainable, the crane chair aims to bring the beauty of this traditional art form closer to people, integrating into their everyday life.

                <p class="detailtext">
                    <strong>Lounge chairs are more than just a place to sit. </strong>They’re lasting designs that often resonate on a deeper level, becoming a cherished part of a person’s daily ritual every time they sit in it. 
                    <br><br>The Crane Dance, which captures the graceful nature of cranes in the wild, integrates cohesively with the chair’s circular construction and natural materials. <br><br>Art isn't an added luxury or decorative element, but is rather woven into the chair’s function. It evokes emotions of the Crane Dance through the uplifting form, with each curve derived from choreographed movements, adding to the experience and the story behind the chair.

                    Inspired by looms used in the traditional textiles and tapestry, the rope weave construction of the Crane Chair pays tribute to the clothing and fabrics worn by the dancers. <br><br>The central backing beam, as well as the tighter weave pattern at the center, mimics traditional East Asian furniture-making techniques from that time period and provides <strong>additional back support</strong>.

                    <strong>PU (Polyurehane) foam</strong> is an environmentally harmful material widely used in lounge chairs and in the furniture industry. The use of recycled cotton ropes to construct the seating surface eliminate the need for any PU cushioning, and provide <strong>flexible support through tension</strong>.<br><br>Combined with sustainably sourcing low carbon materials like pine wood, every part of the Crane Chair is meant to be degradable and fully circular.
