                    Although pre-preg carbon fiber is lighter, <strong>it is not suitable for waterjet cutting</strong> intricate designs compared to wet carbon fiber. I decided to fabricate using a router instead, leading to several design iterations.
                    Additionally, it was later discovered that the cutouts reduced the lengths of the individual fibers in the composite layer, reducing the strength of the structure.

        <p class="subtitle">CNC milling was used in conjunction with manual milling for the aluminum L tabs on the headrest. Fully strength tested like the carbon fiber pieces, the tabs play a crucial role in the structures rigidity.</p>

                    Due to the issue of pre-preg carbon fiber delaminating from the nomex core during waterjet cutting, I manually cut out the carbon fiber pieces using a router and offset acrylic templates. The pieces were later hand-finished with files.
