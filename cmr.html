                    During physical testing of Prototype 2, the waterjet cutter caused delamination of the pre-preg carbon fiber and the nomex core. <br><br>
                    Although pre-preg carbon fiber is lighter compared to wet carbon fiber, <strong>it is not suitable for waterjet cutting</strong> intricate designs. I decided to fabricate using a router instead, leading to several design iterations.
                    Additionally, it was later discovered that the cutouts reduced the lengths of the individual fibers in the composite layer, reducing the strength of the structure.
                   <br><br>
                    Regrettably, cutouts were abandoned after discovering this issue.

                    Due to the issue of pre-preg carbon fiber delaminating from the nomex core during waterjet cutting, I manually cut out the carbon fiber pieces using a router and offset acrylic templates. The pieces were later hand-finished with files.
